>   - Loading and displaying data from a space-delimited file
>   - Plotting data
>   - Pre-processing, cleaning and estimating values for unclean data
>   - Vectorized vs. loop code writing
> During the demonstration of the topics above, core programming concepts covered are: Array  Manipulation, Random Number Generation, Linear & Logical Indexing, Code Vectorization.
