- Loading and displaying data from a space-delimited file
- Plotting data
- Pre-processing, cleaning and estimating values for unclean data
- Vectorized vs. loop code writing

During the demonstration of the topics above, core programming concepts covered are: Array Manipulation, Random Number Generation, Linear & Logical Indexing, Code Vectorization
